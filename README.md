# OSCPlugin
This is a Dalamud plugin to implement Open Sound Control protocol support into FFXIV. The initial goal was to link up PCPanel to the different volume channels in the game. It has since evolved into a more general plugin. If you have some audio control hardware that supports OSC, this is the plugin for you!
