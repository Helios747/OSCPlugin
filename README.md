# PCPanelXIV
This is a highly experimental Dalamud plugin to implement PCPanel support into FFXIV via the Open Sound Control protocol. The goal is to link up PCPanel to the different volume channels in the game. This is only useful to me and a light reference of how to interface with Open Sound Control with .net. It is nowhere near ideal but it does what I want it to.

I might turn it into a proper plugin later.
